 * Ascension Level 50: Act 4 forced
 *
 * TODO: NOT YET IMPLEMENTED - Requires game flow research
 *
 * ???막이 강제됩니다.
 *
 * Implementation requires:
 * - Patch Act 3 boss completion logic
 * - Force transition to Act 4 (Heart fight) instead of ending
 * - Remove player choice for Act 4 entry
 * - Possibly patch victory screen or act transition logic
 *
 * This requires research into act progression and game flow mechanics.
